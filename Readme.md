## The goal of this project
The goal of this project is primarily educational. My goal is to learn about how graph databases function, and how CIPHER works.
The initial goal is to create a cipher compliant library that can run without a database server in the background.

### Current goals
[ ] - independence from simdjson after load
[ ] - Initial cipher compatability CREATE,MATCH,UPDATE,DELETE
[ ] - Type safe representation in C++
